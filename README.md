# Train of Thought

By using two agents to break down a prompt, generate a
chain of thoughts, and verify subproblem outputs, we saw
accuracy and safety improvements over a one-shot approach.
This was inspired by OpenAI's recent o1 model as well as
research in the field of multi-agent LLMs. Currently, the
project uses two instances of Google's Gemini Flash 1.5
model, but this approach can be generalized to any number
and type of models.
